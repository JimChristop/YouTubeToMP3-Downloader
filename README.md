# YouTubeToMP3-Downloader

This project is a YouTube to mp3 downlader created with Python.
It uses Tkinter for GUI and the libray PyTube for downloading the mp3s through youtube links.
It is completely portable, the exe file can be downloaded from the following link : https://www.mediafire.com/file/9r0jynyut4g8c7k/YoutubeToMP3Downloader.zip/file

I wanted to create this little project because I own an mp3 player and I wanted to download music from Youtube. I came to the realization very fast that the online converters are kind of a scam, so I took matters into my own hands.

I hope you like this project and find it useful. The code is fully commented for everyones convinience.
